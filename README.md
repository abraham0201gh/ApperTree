The Apper Tree web application provides member users a platform to quickly present an organized overview of their Apps and professional profile, along with a running list of member submitted Apps for community view and review.  Additionally, members gain early access to upcoming Apps and have the opportunity to receive and give work product commentes.  The App will also serve as an App marketplace for members wishing to monetize their work.  

## App Functions

The Home page displays member submitted Apps in a scrolling format, with each App card displaying a quick synopsis, name and image of the App.  The page displays a short summary of the logged in user's profile and the Apps trending on the site.  Each App listing includes a link to deploy the App and a link to the App developer's profile page.   

A Submit page allows members to submit their Apps to the website.    

Members complete a Profile page with contact information, a listing of professional skills and experience, and a listing with links to their own Apps.
